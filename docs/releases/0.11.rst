Version 0.11
------------
* Support for signed documents verification added, embedded and detached
  signatures are supported.  When verifying a document Mayan EDMS will
  try to fetch the public key from the list of keyservers provided in the
  configuration option SIGNATURES_KEYSERVERS (which defaults to
  'pool.sks-keyservers.net').  A public key management view has been added
  to the setup menu as well as a key query and fetching view to manually
  import keys from a keyserver.

  of versions for a document using a very flexible document version numbering
  system, users can also revert to a previous document version.
