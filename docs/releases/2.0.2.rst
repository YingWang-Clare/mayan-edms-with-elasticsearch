===============================
Mayan EDMS v2.0.2 release notes
===============================

Released: February 15, 2016

Welcome to Mayan EDMS v2.0.2

What's new
==========

Fine tune "Update" checkbox from the metadata entry form
--------------------------------------------------------
Previously the update checkbox was ignored during the metadata step of the
document upload wizard with the wizard always creating a metadata entry for the
new document even if the entry was left blank. The checkbox now controls whether
or not the wizard will store try to create the metadata entry.

Fix empty optional lookup metadata fields behavior
--------------------------------------------------
An edge case was fixed that caused validation to be executed for empty metadata
fields that had a value lookup list.

Remove Docker files
-------------------
Included Docker and Docker Compose files were removed since the Mayan EDMS Docker
(https://gitlab.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms-docker) repository is stable.

Other changes
-------------
- Only extract validation error messages from ValidationError exception instances.
- Add 2 second delay to document version tests to workaround MySQL not storing
  the millisecond part of the document version's timestamp.
- Install testing dependencies when installing development dependencies.
- Fix OCR API test for document version page OCR content.
- Move metadata form value validation to .clean() method.
- Add HTML tags stripping to the browser title generation template.
