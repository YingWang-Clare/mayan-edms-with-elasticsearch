Mayan EDMS v1.0 release notes
=============================

*August 26, 2014*

Welcome to Mayan EDMS v1.0!

Overview
========
After a year of low activity the focus of this release was to get the code
updated to work with the most recent version of Django and the most recent
version of the dependencies Mayan EDMS uses. The goal was to have a strong
and stable 1.0 release so reduction, trimming, warning reductions and bug
fixes were the primary focus of this cycle. Because of this not much
emphasis was placed on adding new features, or at least new features
that could have the potential to break things.

What's new in Mayan EDMS v1.0
=============================

New home
~~~~~~~~
The growth and reach of the project has necessitaded for a while the move
of the project to its own organization in Github. This move has finally been
done, the new URL of the project is: https://github.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms

Django 1.6

not only new features, but also a lot of security updates, a new project
directory structure and new deployment methods.

Model updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There were some convenience properties created to allow quick access to
a document's version and pages. These custom properties were removed and
an official method to access these properties as provided by Django is now
used.

Source code improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A circular import of metadata and document_index apps code from the documents app
was removed. Document index updates are now handled via signals, not called
directly as before. Hundreds of PEP8 style fixes, unused import removals,
unused variables removals and removal of remarked or unused code. Removal of the
DEVELOPMENT flag (was used to trigger static media serving during development),
this is now handled by the DEBUG flag. The DEBUG flag is now set to `True` by
default as per Django 1.6 defaults. Removed usage of Django's JSON libraries
using Python's JSON library instead. Update of time and date use to use Django's
new timezone aware data and time handling. Removal of custom code in favor of using
modules provided by Django or by existing 3rd party libraries. Unification of code
used for equal or similar purpose in various modules.

Removal of included 3rd party modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One last 3rd party module was included with the source code of Mayan EDMS.
This module is now available on PyPI and fetched during the installation instead
of being included.

Automatic testing and code coverage check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some initial tests were added, which will help with the detection of
regressions or bugs when adding new features. More tests are needed, but
the initial work has being started.

Update of required modules and libraries versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Many of the required modules and libraries have been updated to a more
recent version if not to their most recent released version.

Database connection leaks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stale database connection being left open by scheduler tasks are now explictly
closed. This avoids consumption of the pool of database connections, increases
stability and reduces memory usage.

Deletion of detached signatures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Detached signatures can now be deleted, if accidentally added to the wrong document.

Removal of fabric based installations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These files are now part of their own project and located at https://github.com/mayan-edms/mayan-fabric

Pluggable OCR backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A commonly requested feature, it is now possible to write backends drivers
to do document OCR using software or services other than Tesseract.

OCR improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OCR queue state is now reset when reloading Mayan EMDS, avoiding the OCR queue
to remain locked. `unpaper` binary is now an optional pre OCR requirement, the OCR
queue will now continue working is `unpaper` is not installed. Addition of post
OCR processing support for French and German.

License change
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayan EDMS is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. This means many
things but the main change is that inclusion of Mayan EDMS into
commercial products is now explicitly allowed.

PyPI package
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mayan EDMS has been packaged and submitted to the PyPI_ Python Package Index
making it even easier to install and use.

New REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This release feature a completely new REST API and automatic API documentation.
This new API is also used internally by *Mayan EDMS* itself.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
More office document types are now recognized and supported. More file types are now
supported as text files and properly previewed and parsed. Removal of the legacy
runserver.sh and runserver_plus.sh scripts. New document preview generation and
display pipeline, faster, simpler. Inclusion of a proof of concept compressed storage
backend.
