Mayan EDMS v2.1.3 release notes
===============================

Released: June 29, 2016

What's new
==========

This is a bug-fix release and all users are encouraged to upgrade.

Temporary files cleanup
-----------------------
When uploading PDF files that had been OCRed by previous software, the text
parser backend that uses Poppler, would leave behind some temporary files in
the /tmp folder. The issue has been resolved and from the fix a test mixin
system check has been devised that will identify places in the codebase with
similar behaviors, reducing the recurrence of similar issues in the future.

Other changes
-------------
- Add help message when initialsetup migration phase fails. Relates to GitLab issue #296
- Start using self.setdout instead of print as per documentation.
- Fix GitLab issue #295, "When editing a user the top bar jumps to the name of the user".
- Normalize handling of temporary file and directory creation.
- Explicitly check for residual temporary files in tests.
- Add missing temporary file cleanup for office documents.
- Fix file descriptor leak in the document signature download test.
