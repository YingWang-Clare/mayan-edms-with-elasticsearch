Released: May 20, 2016

==========

This is a bugfix release and all users are encouraged to upgrade.

Language list sorting
---------------------
The document language list and the user locale profile language list are now
sorted to make it easier to find the desired language.

Fixed the metadata lookup options: {{ users }} and {{ groups }}
