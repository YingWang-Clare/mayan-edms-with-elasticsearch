Mayan EDMS v2.5 release notes
=============================

Released: July 07, 2017

What's new
==========

OCR text download
-----------------
A link and view were added to download the entire OCR text of a document as a
separate file. The link can be found under the "Actions" dropdown when the
"OCR" tab of a document is selected.

SANE document source
--------------------
A validation error was being raised when the resolution field of the SANE
document source was left blank. This issue has been fixed and works as expected
now.

Mailing profiles
----------------
Previously, the way documents were emailed was controlled by configuration
settings that only system administrator could change as the OS level. It is
now possible to create mailing profiles from within the user interface. This
allows for Mayan administrators to add mailing profiles without the
intervention system administrators. It also provides the opportunity to create
multiple mailing profiles. This is useful for sending documents via different
email providers depending on things like priority of delivery, or email size
limitations. For multi-tenant environments, this also means that each tenant
can now send documents via email with their own respective email accounts.
For system administrators, this means there is no longer a need to rely on a
single email profile for the entirety of all the tenants in a deployment,
which could be taxing email quota limits or triggering spam filters. For
more information on the multi-tenant plugin visit the Mayan app store at:

New transformation
------------------
A lineart transformation was added to reduce the amount of colors in a
document's image to just 2. This is useful to increase the OCR accuracy on
some kind of documents whose color or layout may confuse the OCR engine
and lower the accuracy of the text recognition.

UI reorganization
-----------------
The main menu was been reorganization for clarity of function. The "About" menu
has been renamed to "System" to signify that the items in this menu relate
to system configuration topics. The "Tools" and "Setup" sub-menus, were moved
from the "Profile" menu to the new "System" menu. The "Profile" menu has been
renamed to "User". Additionally, the "User" menu is now part of the main menu
instead of floating right on the layout. This change along with others
improve the usability on small devices like tablets and smartphones.

PDF compatibility updates
-------------------------
Support for non-compliant, "broken", and PDFs encrypted with no passwords has
been added. Previously no effort was made to process the images for these
files. The code for detecting the number of pages in a PDF has also been
improved to retry several methods when failing on non-compliant PDF documents.

Office documents compatibility updates
--------------------------------------
Improvements to the Libre Office conversion code were added, including a
workaround for Libre Office bug #37531 (https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37531)
which sometimes manifested when uploading multiple office documents
sequentially.

Metadata setup UI improvements
------------------------------
A new widget to define the document type to metadata type relationship has been
added. The new widget provides a method to switch between required metadata
and optional metadata for a document type. This new method is not only faster
but does not force users to remove a metadata type before making the switch
and thus avoid deletion of existing metadata entries. A new view was also added
to change the document type to metadata type relation not only the document
type view but also from the metadata type view eliminating travel between these
two views when creating new metadata types and assigning them to document
types.

Duplicated document scanning
----------------------------
Support to scan and list duplicated document scanning was added in the form of
a new document list link under the "Documents" main menu. Every time a document
is uploaded, a document scan will be triggered to determine if the new document
is a duplicate of an existing document. Duplicate documents will be listed
in a new "Duplicated documents" link in the main menu. A full document list
scan can also be triggered by using the new "Duplicated document scan" button
in the tools menu. Finally, a new tab in the document view has been added
called "Duplicates" that will list all duplicates of the currently
selected document when in the document's view. Related to this feature is the
addition of being able to search documents by their checksum. This was done by
indexing the checksum database field and by adding the checksum as a search
field in the advanced document search view and via the API.

Login session control
---------------------
Support was added to control the length of time a log in session lasts. First
from the user interface side of things a "Remember me" checkbox was added to
the log in form that will cause the session to persist after the browser is
closed. If this checkbox is left blank the session will be destroyed when the
browser closes and the user will need to log in again when accessing any of the
URLs. The second part of this feature is for administrators. The configuration
setting AUTHENTICATION_MAXIMUM_SESSION_LENGTH was added to control the maximum
time a logged in session will persist when users click the "Remember me"
checkbox. The default of this setting is 30 days.

Document image cache disabling
------------------------------
It is now possible to disable the document page image caching. The document
image cache works on two level and hence two setting options were added.
The first is the DOCUMENTS_DISABLE_BASE_IMAGE_CACHE option which disables the
first layer of caching, the generation of a master image file for each document
page. This means that subsequent request for a page's image will trigger the
conversion of the document from its original uploaded file. The second option,
DOCUMENTS_DISABLE_TRANSFORMED_IMAGE_CACHE, disables just the caching of the
transformed (rotated, resized, zoomed) images of document pages. The settings
can be used together or separately depending on how much disk space saving is
desired. These settings give control over the trade-off between disk space
savings and higher CPU utilization. These settings are ideal for installations
with a lot of documents, that want to conserve disk space, and have CPU capacity
to spare. Multi-tenant installations can also benefit from these new settings.

Document filter by workflow state
---------------------------------
A few versions over, a main menu item was added to list documents by their
workflow and/or their current workflow state. Support for filtering by the
initial workflow state has been added to this feature.

Support for restoring forgotten password
----------------------------------------
Views and templates were added to enable the typical "Forgotten
password" worflow using a signed token via email.

Other Changes
-------------
- Add missing OCR migration.
- Improve error output of the performupgrade command to debug upgrade errors
  that could stop an upgrade (missing document files, etc).
- Enable the django-mathfilters app added in version 2.4.
- Do a complete pull and synchronization of the translations to fix missing
  translations for Polish. Thanks to Wojtek Warczakowski for the report.
- Allow null for the SANE source resolution field. Even though the field was
  marked as allowing blank values it was failing because it is a number field
  and number fields need to allow explicit null values when left blank.
- Rename the mayan_task_manager app to task_manager.
- Make the task manager translatable.
- Add Turkish to the list of processes languages.
- Use Toastr libary for screen messages.
- Reduce verbosity of some debug messages in the MayanAppConfig, settings and,
  mailing discovery.
- Make sure lookup selection widgets also trigger the metadata update
  checkbox on change.
- Usability improvements on small displays.
- Removal of the CONVERTER_LIBREOFFICE_PATH and CONVERTER_PDFTOPPM_PATH
  settings. These setting have been consolidated into
  CONVERTER_GRAPHICS_BACKEND_CONFIG.
- Improve the documentation of the document creation API endpoint.
  GitHub issue #255. Thanks to @lcerliani opening the issue.
- Libre Office conversion improvements. Give every libreoffice instance
  its own separate $HOME directory. Additionally give every libreoffice
  its own UserInstallation file in the $HOME directory. Works around
  Libre Office issue: https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37531
  Solves or affects GitLab issues #393 #258 #198 #175
- The trashed document deletion action is now a background task. This
  feature results is much faster trashed document deletion and trash
  can emptying.
- Remove animated spinners to lower browser memory usage and increase
  responsiveness.
- Render a document page placeholder while the real document page
  loads. This change avoids "jumping" effect when loading many thumbnails.
- Increase lazy load thresholds. More thumbnails and document pages
  will be loaded and visible by default when a view loads.
- Improve usability and appearance on medium and small devices like
  tablets and smartphones.
- Do hard word break on form titles to avoid horizontal scroll on
  small displays.
- Python3 compatilibty improvements by removing all explicit conversion
  using the unicode() function.
- Unicode handling improvements.
- Update required versions of Pillow and django-suit.
