Release notes
=============

Release notes for the official Mayan EDMS releases. Each release note will tell you
what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

For those upgrading to a new version of Mayan EDMS, you will need to check
all the backwards-incompatible changes and deprecated features for
each 'final' release from the one after your current Mayan EDMS version,
up to and including the latest version.

Final releases

Below are release notes through Mayan EDMS |version| and its minor releases. Newer
