Document types
==============

The basic unit of data in Mayan EDMS is the ``document type``. A document
type can be interpreted also as a document category, a document class, or a
document template. Document types need to be created before documents can be
uploaded. It is not possible to upload documents without assigning them a
document type. Examples of document type: **invoices**, **blueprints**,
**receipts**.

Settings and attributes are applied to document types and documents will
inherit those settings and attributes based on the document type they were
assigned when uploaded into Mayan EDMS. A document can only be of one
type at a given moment, but if needed, the type of a document can be changed.
Upon changing its type, the document will lose its previous settings and
attributes, and will inherit the settings and attributes of its new type.
