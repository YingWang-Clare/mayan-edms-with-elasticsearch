Tags allow giving documents a binary property. Documents can also be tagged
with more than one tag. Once tagged, documents can be searched also by their
tags and from the tags main menu a list of all the documents with a particular
tag can be obtained easily. Aside from their texts, tags can be assigned a
particular color.
