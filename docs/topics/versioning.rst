===================
Document versioning
===================

Mayan EDMS has the ability to store different versions of the same
document. A comment field is provided to allow users to summarize the new
version changes in comparison with the previous one. If a new version was
uploaded by mistake or such new version is no longer necessary the option to
revert to a previous version of the document is provided.

Only the interactive document sources (:doc:`sources`) (``Web`` and ``Staging folders``) are
available to upload new document versions.
