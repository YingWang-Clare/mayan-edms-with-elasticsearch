version notes:

July 26th: the version that was uploaded to the work station is the first version.

July 26th: local modifications:
1. Set elastic search parameters as global constant variables in settings
2. Fix errors in each related models: cabinets, commments, tags
since the fields in elastic search changes.


July 26th: create my own repo on github: mayan-edms-with-elasticsearch
on work station, git clone that repo
on my local machine, the dir name is mayan-edms-dev
every time modifying the code in mayan-edms-dev, just commit the changes, and push them.
then on the work station, git pull to make everything up to date.
